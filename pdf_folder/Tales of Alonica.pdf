  					Chapter-1

“Mom, I need some more”, cried Ria keeping the empty bamboo bowl on the table. She felt another bowl of gruel being placed on the table but this eight-year-old blind girl is smart enough to recognise that these foot-steps are not her mamma’s. “Dad! Are you home?”, she asked confidently. No reply. Dad it’s you, this time with a low voice. No reply again, but now the footsteps are approaching her, the intensity of sound made by rumbling clouds outside is no longer bearable, the howl of the wind entering the room through the windows coming all the way from the dense forest, the darkness, the thunder and the creaking of wood altogether making the scene no better than a nightmare. 
	The footsteps almost approached her and she is now feeling the warmth of the air exhaled by the man. She now kept her little hand under the table and caught a knife tucked in her socks and drove it ferociously to cut the man’s throat. “Excellent!”, a roaring voice broke the silence. “Excellent! My dear, this brutal attempt would have killed anyone, but not your dad, my baby.” Dad it’s you, don’t you find any better way to test my skills, yelled Ria, However, you just saw my skills, how are they? Well done my dear, they are certainly better than yesterday but not enough for tomorrow, he said, looking at his wife Isha, who has been watching the entire scene from the kitchen. Isha’s smile evaporated as if she heard a terrible news. Ria reverted back to her room taking an extra bowl of gruel. 
	“Did you find anything?” asked Isha. No, the weather is quite abnormal, and it’s getting dark, so I couldn’t make deep into the jungle and all our traps were blown away by this merciless wind. I was worried about you people and this little wooden shelter of ours. I came empty handed. It's okay Ayan, we were also expecting you to come early. I am still wondering; how could this little shelter be still standing against this terrible wind and…. “Because it has owed to protect our family”, Ayan interrupted. But how long are we going to hide in this forest? Our children, don’t even know that there is a world lying beyond these woods, they still feel that we are the only human species in this so-called world of theirs’_ forest of Alonica, said Isha. Where is Shiv? Questioned Ayan trying to change the topic. He is in the training room, was her reply. 
	Ayan is now walking to the store-room (training room) to look at his ten-year-old son. He slowly opened the door and walked into the room, and was shocked to see his son sleeping. Shiv!! Shouted Ayan, what are you doing? We don’t have time to sleep. Dad, I was done with my workout today and I’m just taking a nap. “Oh! Is it? let me see.” Ayan took a device from his pocket and sticked it to the wall”.  This device can measure the power of a punch, I want to know the strength of my son, now”, he said to himself. What is it dad? Is it a painting? But it’s too small. “Shiv, give it a punch using all your strength.”, ordered father. As it sounded like a serious order, Shiv couldn’t dare to question his dad. He closed his eyes, took a deep breathe, tightened his fist this made his nerves to bulge, the repeated movements of his nerves confirms that the blood in his body is now flowing at no ordinary speed, one can easily say that he has learnt to control his blood flow. He now, slowly opened his eyes and started looking at that device, held his fist high at his shoulder level and gave it a strong hit. His blow was too hard that the device was broken into two. “This can measure ten units, my punch power is 5 units, an aggressive bear can give a punch of 8 units. I think the device might have gone defective”, Ayan said to himself. He asked his son to go to his room, rest for some time while he’ll be cleaning the room for his next session. While cleaning, he found a broken piece of the device in which the analogue needle is pointing to 10 units! “My God!!! I knew it… I knew it... It’s time”, shrieked Isha- she has been watching the entire scene from the window. She came to her husband and said with quick gasps,” I’ll bring it..
